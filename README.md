# Open Spelling Bee (OSB)

# 🐝

Open source porject of New York Times' puzzle game Spelling Bee for the command line.

Requires Python 3.x and nothing but standard Python libraries.

## to play

To download the game:

    git clone https://github.com/philshem/open-spelling-bee.git
    cd open-spelling-bee

To play a random game:

    python3 play_puzzle.py

To play a non-random game:

    python3 play_puzzle.py RDGHNOU

where `R` is the center letter that must be used at least once in each word. If the puzzle `RDGHNOU` does not exist, it will be created and saved to `data/RDGHNOU.json` (the file names are the first letter and the alphabetically sorted remaining letters).

⚠️ The word list used is from Scrabble: [TWL06](https://www.wordgamedictionary.com/twl06/), and at roughly 180k words, it's larger than what the NY Times uses. To reach "genius" level, you'll need to solve 50% of the words.

To solve a game (aka cheat-mode):

    python3 solve_puzzles.py RDGHNOU

If the game does not exist, it will be created and saved to the `data/` folder. 

For a list of the previous NY Times letter selections, see [William Shunn's page](https://www.shunn.net/bee/?past=1).

## to generate new puzzles

Set custom parameters in the `params.py` file, for example how many puzzles you want to create. Then generate by running:

    python3 generate_puzzles.py

Or to save the word stats:

    python3 generate_puzzles.py > stats.csv

Runtime depends on your parameters. For the default parameter settings, the code takes approximately 8 hours to generate 100 7-letter puzzles that meet the criteria (total points, total words, pangram count).

To generate a certain letter combination, use:

    python3 generate_puzzles.py AGFEDCB

which will then be saved to `data/ABCDEFG.json`.

# Game Play

To play, build words with a minimum of 4 letters, using the letters provided.

Each word must include the center letter at least once.

Letters may be used as many times as you'd like.

Scoring: 1 point for a 4 letter word, and 1 more point for each additional letter.

Each puzzle has 1 "pangram" that uses each of the 7 letters at least once. The pangram is worth 7 extra points.
